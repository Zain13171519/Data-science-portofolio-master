Election Poll Data Analysis¶
In this project, we'll look at the opinion poll data from the upcoming 2016 General Election. In the process, we'll try to answer the following questions:

Who was being polled and what was their party affiliation?
Did the poll results favour Clinton or Trump?
How did voter sentiment change over time?
Can we see an effect in the polls from the debates?
So let's get started with the imports!

#Data Analysis imports
import pandas as pd
from pandas import Series,DataFrame
import numpy as np
​
#Visualisation imports
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
sns.set_style('whitegrid')
%matplotlib inline
​
from __future__ import division
​
#Imports to grab and parse data from the web
import requests
​
from StringIO import StringIO
We'll grab the poll data from HuffPost Pollster, and we'll use StringIO to prevent errors with pandas.

#url for the poll data
url = "http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/2016-general-election-trump-vs-clinton.csv"
​
#Using requests to get the data in text form
source = requests.get(url).text
​
#Using String IO to prevent IO errors with pandas
poll_data = StringIO(source)
#Reading the csv object into a pandas dataframe
poll_df = pd.read_csv(poll_data)

Who was being polled and what was their party affiliation?
Quickly visualising the affiliations of the different pollsters.

sns.factorplot('Affiliation',data=poll_df,kind='count')
<seaborn.axisgrid.FacetGrid at 0x119021cd0>

Most of the polls have no affiliation; though there's stronger affiliation for Democrats than for Republicans.

sns.factorplot('Affiliation',data=poll_df,hue='Population',kind='count')
<seaborn.axisgrid.FacetGrid at 0x11904ff10>

As there's a strong sample of registered voters that are not affiliated, we can hope that the poll data is a good representation of the upcoming elections.

The difference is Clinton - Trump. So a positive difference indicates a Clinton lead, and a negative difference indicates a Trump lead.

The visualisation indicates that Trump has a slight lead in the polls, on average. Keep in mind that this is without accounting for the weights of different polls, demographics, and affiliations of the population polled.

The latest start date in our grouped dataframe is 27-September-2016.

Can we see an effect in the polls from the debates?
Another interesting thing that we can look into, is what happened on the days leading up to the first debate, and afterwards. We know that the debate was on 26-September-2016, so we'll plot the trends for the month of September.

To get a list of indices for September, we'll loop through the dataframe, and append any row with a September start date to the list.

row_in = 0
xlimit = []
​
for date in poll_df['Start Date']:
    if date[0:7] == '2016-09':
        xlimit.append(row_in)
        row_in += 1
    else:
        row_in += 1
        
print "First September Index: " + str(min(xlimit))
print "Last (Available) September Index: "+ str(max(xlimit))
First September Index: 209
Last (Available) September Index: 229
poll_df.plot('Start Date','Difference',figsize=(15,4),marker='o',linestyle='-',xlim=(209,229))
​
#Vertical line for debate date
plt.axvline(x=228)
<matplotlib.lines.Line2D at 0x119431850>

And what it looks like, is that the sentiment shifted slightly in favour of Trump, after the debate. Again, it's important to keep in mind that we're dealing with averages.
